# _pandoc-actions_

This workflow demonstrates a GitHub Action which uses [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) to convert a simple Pandoc Markdown file, `docs/SLIDES.md`, to an interactive [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) slideshow presentation. The output HTML file is then uploaded to the GitHub repository as a build artifact, which is available for [download through the GitHub repository](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/downloading-workflow-artifacts) (through the web browser, CLI, [or even another Action](https://github.com/actions/download-artifact)) _without_ having to commit the build artifact to source.
